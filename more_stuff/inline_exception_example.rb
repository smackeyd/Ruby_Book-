puts "After each call"

# The rescue runs because it isn't possible to call the each method on an Integer which is the value of the zero variable.
# If we remove the rescue block, the second puts method will not execute because the program will exit when it runs into the error. 
# You can see why the word "rescue" is relevant here. We are effectively rescuing our program from coming to a grinding halt.
# If we give this same code the proper variable, our rescue block never gets executed.
